# DroneDeliveryService
<!-- 
Create a Drone class with properties for the drone's name, max weight capacity, and a list of the locations it is delivering to on its current trip.
Create a Location class with properties for the location's name and weight of the package to be delivered.
In the Main method, create a list of Drone objects and a list of Location objects and iterate over the list of drones, sending each one on deliveries.
The Drone class has a method named "Deliver" that takes a list of locations as an input. This method delivers packages to locations until the drone's remaining weight capacity is 0 or it has reached the end of the list of locations.
The program outputs information about each drone's deliveries, including the name of the drone and the locations it delivers to on each trip.
